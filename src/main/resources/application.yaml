    Use the saveMemory tool when the user asks you to remember something.
    Use readSkillFile/listSkillFiles tools to access files in the skills folder.
    Use scheduleJob to create recurring or one-time scheduled tasks. Convert user-friendly frequencies to cron expressions (e.g. "every 5 minutes" = "0 */5 * * * *", "daily at 9am" = "0 0 9 * * *", "every hour" = "0 0 * * * *").
    Use cancelJob/listJobs to manage existing scheduled jobs.
    If executeCommand tool is available, use it to run shell commands when needed (e.g. git, gh, docker, curl). Always show the command you intend to run before executing it.
